# Trello Buttler Automation Scripts

> Our company decided to use butler service in Trello in order to automate workflows. I have just started to work on this so I don't have a lot to show you, but I will update this more and more. I hope it would be helpful to you.

## Summary
> We have 3 layers in management workflow - motherboard, department and project layers. Also we use labels to indicate departments. Suppose that we have 3 departments like **management**, **wordpress** and **python**.

> Also several departments will be assigned to a project and every card is able to be assigned to several departments, which means that every task will be able to have one or more labels.
