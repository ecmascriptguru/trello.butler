# Website layer board.

## Lists on this board
### Backlog
    There are different types of work here. Notice the infographic label, it doesn't go to the content board until moved into "Todo".
    The work types are "wordpress", "issue" and "infographic".

### Todo
    In this stage the infographic goes to the content board and waits in the incoming list. When it is started in the content department it moves to in progress on this website board.

### Doing
    In this list, we will have all cards that are in progress in other boards like content board and outreach board. In order to show the status we will use labels. So the label names will be like "{board_name} : {status}". So this feature will be implemented in other boards like department board(outreach board) and sub process board.
