# Trello Buttler Automation Scripts

Our company decided to use butler service in Trello in order to automate workflows. I have just started to work on this so I don't have a lot to show you, but I will update this more and more. I hope it would be helpful to you.

## Summary
> We have 4 layers in management workflow - motherboard, department, project and user layers. Also we use labels to indicate departments. Suppose that we have 3 departments like **management**, **wordpress** and **python**. The purpose of those layers is to make it easy for every role to check workload according departments, projects and users

> Also several departments will be assigned to a project and every card is able to be assigned to several departments, which means that every task will be able to have one or more labels.

### Motherboard will have the following lists.
- Projects
- Backlog
- To Do
- In Progress
- Ready for Department Review
- Ready for Project Review
- Done
- We will create a statistics panel to show something about workflow for departments later.

### Every department board will the following lists.
- Incoming
- Estimate
- To Do
- In Progress
- Ready for Department Review
- Ready for Project Review
- Done

### Similarily every project board will have the following lists.
